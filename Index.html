                My Fraternity, Triangle, sent me and my fraternity brother, Chris, to be representatives at the Triangle National Convention 
                in Irvine, CA. Chris and I, being college students, did not have the money to buy a plane tickets, so we opted to drive out. 
                Also being college students, both of us had rather used vehicles. We ended up taking Chris's 1991 Toyota Camery... 
                accross country. Suprisingly, we make it there in one piece and enjoy our weekend at the event.
            </p>
            <p class="second-paragraph">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our plan for heading back was to go down through Highway 30 through the southern states and get back to Missouri in a little over
                a day. Both of us had work on Tuesday so we needed to leave Sunday night drive through the night and all day the next day to make 
                it on time. What could go wrong?

            <p class="first-paragraph">
                The sun rise blined both of us as we were well into Arizona. We were well and truely in the middle of nowhere. I go to overtake an
                18 wheeler when the car suddenly seems to jump. The back drivers side tire blew out. I regain control of the car and pull off to the
                side of the road. As I put the donut on the car, Chris asks Siri where the next car repair shop is. She informs us that it is 50
                miles up ahead.
            </p>
            <p class="second-paragraph">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We make it to the 50 mile mark where we discover that Siri sent us to a junk yard rather than an auto shop. Thanks Siri. Thankfully, 
                an actual shop was just up the road, so we weren't stranded. The repair shop tells us that they do not have the tire but a shop up the 
                road does. As we are getting ready to leave, they ask us to pop the hood. We comply and they tell us that we need to change the battery 
                or else it will Explode. We promptly ignore the warning believing it to be them trying to con us out of our limited cash. After spending
                an hour and $100 on the tire, we get back on the road.

            <p class="first-paragraph">
                We make it about 15 miles into New Mexico when I realize that we are almost out of gas. We once go to Siri to ask where the 
                nearest gas station is. Siri directs us back 15 miles, instrusts us to get off exit 0, go over the bridge, and take a right 
                down the outer road. In a half mile, we reached Siri's destination... an open field. 
            </p>
            <p id="fun-paragraph">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We made it to an actual gas station with dropplets to spare. To add insult to injury, when we got 18 miles into New Mexico, we 
                passed a Shell station. It was at this point that I wanted to throw Chris's phone out the window.

            <p class="first-paragraph">
                We make it to some city in Texas. I don't really remember which city as neither I nor Chris cared much at this point. We stop off
                at a Walmart for some snacks and energy drinks for the still long road ahead. when we get back to the car, the engine won't even 
                turn over. Turns out that the mechanic's warning was not totally fabricated because while the battery did not explode like they 
                had warned, it was very much dead.
            </p>
            <p class="second-paragraph">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We roll it back to the mechanic at Walmart and ask for a new battery. They tell us that a few people are in front of us, but they
                would get to it soon. We were there for 3 hours. Honestly, we should have just done it ourselves, but neither of us were really 
                thinking clearly from exhaution.

            <p class="first-paragraph">
                We make it to Oklahoma a little after 5PM. Chris is taking his turn behind the wheel and is saying that the car is wanting to 
                drift to the left a bit. We get out to find that another one of his tires is threatening to blow out. We can see the wire that 
                is supposed to be inside the tire. Most of the repair shops were closed at this point, but staying in Oklahoma over night was 
                not an option. We had already had to get money wired to us from my family to fix the other issues and I really did not want to 
                ask for more.
            </p>
            <p class="second-paragraph">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find a mechanic leaving his shop and flag him down. After explaining our situation, he was more than willing to give us a hand, 
                for a price. Along with the $100 for the tire itself, he said that he would tack on another $100 for the emergency service. Having 
                no other option, we begrugingly accepted his terms and were on the road an hour later.

            <p class="first-paragraph">
                Finally! We make it to Missouri. We both give a sigh of relief as we feel like we are finally on the last leg of the journey.
                We look behind in the rear view mirror and witness one of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen. Oranges, Pinks, and Blues
                streak accross the sky as the sunlight peers through the clouds. However this was not the scene that laid before us.
            </p>
            <p class="second-paragraph">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant storm clouds towered in front of us. Flashes of lightning peered through every layer of the cloud. Desperate to finish our 
                journey, we drove on into the storm. It was raining so hard, we did not see the road from Joplin to Rolla. Our lives were not fully
                in our hands if we tried to over take any other vehicle. Once we got to Rolla, we camped out at the Fraternity until the storm 
                passed. We headed out in the morning, I dropped him off at his house, and drove off to my job. I didn't even have time to swing by
                my house.
